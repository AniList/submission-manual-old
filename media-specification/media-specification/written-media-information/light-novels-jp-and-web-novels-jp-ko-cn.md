# Web Novels \(TO BE DELETED\)

## Database Criteria

Web novels can be added to the website if they meet the following criteria:

1. The web novel is not an occidental work. It must be of Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, or Korean origins. 
2. The web novel must be professionally published through a reputable publisher \(Example: [Kadokawa](https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/), [Ichijinsha](http://www.ichijinsha.co.jp/), [Qidian](https://www.qidian.com/)’s VIP etc\). 
3. The web novel is _**not**_ from an online self-publishing platform, where anyone can upload anything. \(Example: [Syosetu](https://syosetu.com/), [17k](http://www.17k.com/), [jjwxc](http://www.jjwxc.net/), [Munpia](http://www.munpia.com/), [Joara](http://www.joara.com/)\).

The third condition can be waived if a self-published work is picked up by a professional publisher _**of the same language.**_

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a self-published web novel from a site such as [Syosetu ](http://syosetu.com)is later professionally published as a [light novel](light-novels.md), the light novel entry would be eligible for submission under the date that the light novel serialisation began.

The original web novel publication should _**not**_ be added.  
This means [Syosetu ](http://syosetu.com)works are completely denied.

## **Examples**

Example 1:

> [Wuxiaworld Limited](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/) translating into English a self-published Chinese novel on [17k ](http://www.17k.com/)is _**not**_ permitted.

Example 2:

> Self-publishing sites that ‘_contract_’ authors that meet readership requirements, or similar parter-style deals, do _**not**_ count as official publishing.  
> \(Example: [Zongheng ](http://www.zongheng.com/)and [Qidian Contracted Works](https://www.qidian.com/) ‘_signing_’ authors over a minimum readership count\).
