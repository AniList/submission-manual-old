# One-Shots

### Database Criteria

One-shots can be added to the site provided they been published in a reputable, professional, magazine. They are single, standalone works with a self-contained story. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Self-published works are not classed as one-shots. However, if the author is already serialised, self-published works could instead possibly be classed as [doujinshi](doujinshi.md).
{% endhint %}

### Compilations and Anthologies

It is acceptable for _**both**_ the standalone one-shot and any anthology or collection it is compiled into to be added to the website. These must be linked through the ‘**contains**’ and '**compilation**' ****[relations](../../../submission-form/relations.md).

Example:

> The now-defunct magazine, _Pure Yuri Anthology Hirari_, which solely published one-shots, released an anthology containing a selection of six of their one-shots:
>
> Adding [Isshun no Asterism](https://anilist.co/manga/104980) \(one-shot\) _****_to [Shuuden ni wa Kaeshimasu](https://anilist.co/manga/85662/Shuuden-ni-wa-Kaeshimasu/) \(anthology\) with the '_**contains'**_ relation automatically adds [Shuuden ni wa Kaeshimasu](https://anilist.co/manga/85662/Shuuden-ni-wa-Kaeshimasu/) as the '_**compilation'**_ to [Isshun no Asterism](https://anilist.co/manga/104980), and vice versa.

In the case of retroactively creating standalone entries when the compiled volume already exists in the database, the standalone one-shot _**must**_ have the date when it was first printed, not the date the anthology or collection was released \(where applicable\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Compilations one-shots should have the ‘_Manga_’ [format](../../../submission-form/general/typings/untitled-6.md).
{% endhint %}
