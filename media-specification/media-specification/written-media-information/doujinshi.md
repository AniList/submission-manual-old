# Doujinshi

## Database Criteria

Doujinshi can be added to the website if it meets all the following criteria:

1. The doujinshi is by an _**already**_ serialised mangaka. 
2. It meets the Japanese '[Country Of Origin](../../../submission-form/general/typings/untitled-8.md)'. 
3. The doujinshi is not based on existing published material \(anime, manga, manhwa etc.\) - it must be an _**original**_ work.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The ‘_original work_’ rule can be waived if the doujinshi in question is by the original author of the existing material.

Example:  
[R of Black Lagoon](https://anilist.co/manga/87131/R-of-Blacklagoon/) is a doujinshi of [Black Lagoon](https://anilist.co/manga/30735/Black-Lagoon/) published by the original author, [Hiroe Rei](https://anilist.co/staff/97578/Rei-Hiroe).
