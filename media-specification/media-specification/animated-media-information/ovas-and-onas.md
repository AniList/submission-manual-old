# OVAs, ONAs, and Specials

## Database Criteria

OVA’s \(Original Video Animations\), ONA’s \(Original Net Animations\), and Specials \(episodes that are aired similarly as the original broadcast but are aired separately\) are all permitted on AniList.

## OVA

An OVA is a title that released directly to home video via something like VHS, LD, DVD, BD, etc.

For an OVA series to be combined into a single entry, it should be released on a semi-regular schedule and/or should have a shared continuity \(see Example 3\).

For OVA’s that are attached to a parent series, they should be combined only if they apply to the same parent series \(see Example 1\).

Example 1:

> [Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. OVA](https://anilist.co/anime/18753/Yahari-Ore-no-Seishun-Love-Comedy-wa-Machigatteiru-OVA/), an OVA alongside the first season of the show, was bundled with a limited edition console game.  
>   
> However, another entry would be made if the OVA in question has a tie-in to a specific season, such as [Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku: Kitto, Onnanoko wa Osatou to Spice to Suteki na Nanika de Dekiteiru](https://anilist.co/anime/21769/Yahari-Ore-no-Seishun-Love-Comedy-wa-Machigatteiru-Zoku-Kitto-Onnanoko-wa-Osatou-to-Spice-to-Suteki-na-Nanika-de-Dekiteiru/).

Example 2:

> [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! OVA](https://anilist.co/anime/21574/Kono-Subarashii-Sekai-ni-Shukufuku-wo-OVA/), an OVA alongside the first season of the show, was bundled with a volume of the light novel.  
>   
> However, [Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 OVA](https://anilist.co/anime/97996/Kono-Subarashii-Sekai-ni-Shukufuku-wo-2-OVA/), is its own separate entry as it was tied into the second season of the airing TV show.

Example 3:

> The show [Kidou Senshi Gundam UC](https://anilist.co/anime/6336/Kidou-Senshi-Gundam-UC/) was aired in a set schedul,e with each episode following a singular continuity, so it is combined.

## ONA

An ONA is a type of series that airs online for its original broadcast release.

## Special

A work will be labelled special if the production company labels it as such. A special is also a work that is uniquely different than it’s parent series, whether that be a picture drama, a short, a pilot, etc.
