# Anime

## Database Criteria

There are limitations to the anime that can be accepted to the site, notably there should be significant creative control of the titles from Japanese studios and be professionally produced.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if a title is animated by these studios, it may not be added to the site due to significant creative decisions being made by western companies.

## Examples

Example 1:

> [Bakemonogatari ](https://anilist.co/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari/)was produced by the Japanese studio [Shaft](https://anilist.co/studio/44/Shaft), and the primary staff \(director, writers, etc\) are also Japanese.

Example 2:

> [RWBY ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY)has a Japanese dub and was broadcast on Japanese TV, however, as it was produced by an American company _\(Rooster Teeth_\) and its primary staff \(director, writers, etc.\) are also American, it would not meet our anime guidelines.
