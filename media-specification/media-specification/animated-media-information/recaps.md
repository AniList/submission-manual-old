# Recaps

## Database Criteria

Recaps are only to be added if the format is different from the original \(Example: TV to Movie\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
If a recap is aired mid-season as a part of the broadcast, it is _**not**_ to be added.

Recap specials that pre-air before the series are also not accepted.
{% endhint %}

Other than the aforementioned format change, recaps are accepted under the condition that it is intended to be part of the series’ total episode count.

## Examples

Example 1:

> [Re:CREATORS](https://anilist.co/anime/97980/ReCREATORS/) has a recap episode as its 13th episode that counts towards its 22 episode count. However, in [3-gatsu no Lion Recap \(MAL\)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34647/3-gatsu_no_Lion_Recap), episode 11.5 is not a conventionally numbered episode, as denoted by the “.5”, and thus _**not**_ counted toward its total 22 episode count.
>
> Some titles will refer to these X.5 episodes with titles like “intermission”. In cases like these, they still will not be added to AniList.
