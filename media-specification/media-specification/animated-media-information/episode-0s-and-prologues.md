# Episode 0’s and Prologues

## Database Criteria

Episode 0’s and prologues that air as part of an upcoming series are included in the main series entry, _**not**_ separated into a single-episode entry.

{% hint style="info" %}
Episode 0's and Prologues that were released in a different format from the TV broadcast \(such as a web-only release or DVD-only release\) are still accepted and fall under the relevant media formats of OVA, ONA, and such.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This means that the episode count will be one higher than on other databases, such as [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net), where prologues and episode 0's in the same series are separated into standalone entries.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

Example 1:

> [Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works](https://anilist.co/anime/19603/Fatestay-night-Unlimited-Blade-Works/) '_Episode 0 - Prologue_' which aired just prior to the rest of the season.

Example 2:

> [Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai Episode 0](https://anilist.co/anime/10897/Boku-wa-Tomodachi-ga-Sukunai-Episode-0/) was released as an [OVA ](ovas-and-onas.md)alongside a volume of the light novel. As the [format](../../../submission-form/general/typings/untitled-6.md) differs from the main TV series, it would have a separate entry.
