# Manhwa

## Database Criteria

There is a limitation on manhwa that can be accepted to the site, notably they should be professionally published works through a reputable Korean publisher.

_**Don’t**_ accept works from parts of sites \(and others\) where any users can submit works, such as [Naver](https://comic.naver.com/)’s '_Best Challenge/Challenge_' section, or [Daum](http://webtoon.daum.net/)’s '_League_' section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Works should _**not**_ be published through self-publishing platforms such as [Tapas.io](http://Tapas.io). This condition can be waived if an official adaptation/translation of existing professionally published material is being legally hosted on one of these sites or if the title in question is later picked up by a professional publisher _**of the same language.**_
{% endhint %}

[Kakao Page](https://page.kakao.com/main) \(and other companies like them\) are generally acceptable as they review titles before deciding to publish them on their platforms.
