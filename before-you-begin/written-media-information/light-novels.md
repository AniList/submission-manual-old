# Light Novels

## Database Criteria

Light novels can be added to the website if they meet all the following criteria:

1. The light novel must be of Japanese origin.  
2. The light novel must be professionally published through a reputable publisher from companies such as [Kadokawa](https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/), [Kodansha](http://www.kodansha.co.jp/), [Alphapolis](https://www.alphapolis.co.jp/), and [Hobby Japan](http://hobbyjapan.co.jp/).  
3. The light novel is specified as being such by the publisher, author, or the majority of major retailers.

Example light novel labels include things such as:

[Bishoujo Bunko](http://www.bishojobunko.jp/) \(**adult**\)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Tokuten \(bonus booklets and such\) are not added to the database.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a self-published web novel from a site such as [Syosetu ](http://syosetu.com)is later professionally published as a [light novel](light-novels.md), the light novel entry would be eligible for submission under the date that the light novel serialisation began.

The original web novel publication should _**not**_ be added.  
This means works from Japanese self-publishing websites such as [Syosetu ](http://syosetu.com)are completely denied.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Chinese and Korean web novels are _**not**_ accepted on this website.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

Example 1:

> The original self-published [Syosetu ](http://ncode.syosetu.com/s2691b/)release of [KonoSuba ](https://anilist.co/manga/86238/Kono-Subarashii-Sekai-ni-Shukufuku-wo/)is _**not**_ permitted, however the [Kadokawa ](https://kadokawa.co.jp)published [light novel serialisation](https://sneakerbunko.jp/series/konosuba/) under their [Sneaker Bunko](https://sneakerbunko.jp/) imprint _**is**_ allowed.

Example 2:

> The [Monogatari Series](https://anilist.co/manga/44893/) toes the line between appearing as a hard or light novel. It is [published](http://kodansha-box.jp/topics/nishio/index.html) in [Kodansha BOX](http://kodansha-box.jp/), which is a hybrid label, but the work is mixed media \(contains illustrations\) and is mostly labelled as a light novel by the general community in both Japan and overseas \(readers, large retailers etc\).

Example 3:

> [Spice and Wolf](https://anilist.co/manga/39115) debuted as a prize-winning work in the 12th Dengeki Novel Awards. This awarded it serialisation in [Dengeki Bunko](https://dengekibunko.jp/product/spice-and-wolf/), a light novel imprint.
