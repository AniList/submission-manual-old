## Database Criteria

There is a limitation on manga that can be accepted to the site, notably they should works that were first published through a reputable Japanese publisher. [Doujinshi](doujinshi.md) is an exception, please refer to that section.

Example magazines include things such as:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Print Magazines" %}
[Weekly Shounen Jump](http://www.shonenjump.com/)  
[Comic Earthstar ](https://comic-earthstar.jp/)  
[Manga Time Kirara](http://www.dokidokivisual.com/)  
[Kindai Mahjong](http://kinma.takeshobo.co.jp/)  
[Betsuma](http://betsuma.shueisha.co.jp/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Web Magazines" %}
[Comic Bunch](http://www.comicbunch.com/)  
[Ganma!](https://ganma.jp/)  
[Sunday Webry](https://www.sunday-webry.com/)  
[LEED Cafe](http://leedcafe.com/)  
[Dengeki @vitamin](http://dc.dengeki.com/vitamin/)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

There are many sites that work with multiple publishers to release serialisations digitally, such as [PixivComic](https://comic.pixiv.net/), [ComicWalker](https://comic-walker.com/), and [Nico Nico Seiga](https://seiga.nicovideo.jp/).

Works published on sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) or [Pixiv](http://pixiv.net)’s non-comic section are usually not accepted _**unless**_ they are titled works uploaded by an author already in serialisation, in which they’ll be classed as [doujinshi](doujinshi.md).

Any accepted works from [Comico](https://www.comico.jp) or similar webtoon portals should be from the official section only, and not the self-publishing challenge section.

## Doujinshi into Manga

If series originally self-published online through platforms like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) or [Pixiv](http://pixiv.net) \(considered [doujinshi](doujinshi.md)\) are later picked up by a professional publisher and released without significant change, any existing entry in AniList under the doujinshi format would be [updated](../../submission-form/general/misc/licensed.md) to manga \(retaining the original self-published start date\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the serialisation is an _**entirely**_ new work, and not a re-publication of the original chapters, a new entry should be made using the start date as the date of serialisation. The original work could still be eligible to enter the database as doujinshi.
{% endhint %}

### Examples

Example 1:

> [Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi](https://anilist.co/manga/103111/Senpai-ga-Uzai-Kouhai-no-Hanashi/) was first released on Twitter \([here](https://twitter.com/i/moments/969629425087082498)\) for a short period of time before the publisher [Ichijinsha](http://ichijinsha.co.jp) began collating the original Twitter posts into tankoubon \([here](https://bookwalker.jp/series/156182/list/)\).  
>   
> Ichijinsha's publication is of the original work itself \(with redrawn art for earlier chapters\) and not a new story. If the entry did already exist on AniList as [doujinshi](doujinshi.md), it would have been be updated to manga and the cover later updated to the tankoubon volume.

Example 2:

> [Sanpakugan-chan wa Tsutaetai.](https://anilist.co/manga/104776/Sanpakuganchan-wa-Tsutaetai/) was first released on Twitter \([here](https://twitter.com/syunsuke1009/status/1004317076788408320)\) before the publisher [GANGANpixiv](https://gangan.pr-pixiv.net/) began serialisation.  
>   
> Like the first example, this also could have been eligible to be entered as doujinshi at first, if meeting the other requirements.
>
> Also like the first example, the serialisation is a re-publication of the first chapters with minor adjustment.

Example 3:

> [Inaka ni Kaeru to Yakeni Jiben ni Natsuita Kasshoku Ponytail Shota ga Iru](https://anilist.co/manga/104991) was first released on Twitter \([here](https://twitter.com/ferea86/status/956556083484540928)\) before the publisher [GENEpixiv ](https://comic.pixiv.net/magazines/88)began serialisation.  
>   
> Like the above examples, this also could have been eligible to be entered as doujinshi at first, if meeting the other requirements.
>
> Also like the above examples, the serialisation is a re-publication of the first chapters with minor adjustment.
