# Image Dimensions, and Templates

All images \(except banners\) should ideally be close to a portrait 2:3 ratio.

Volume covers for manga and light novels - and many key illustrations for anime - aren't an exact 2:3 ratio, however, they should be uploaded untouched.

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is an exception to the 2:3 ratio for _temporary_ covers such as announcement images for new serializations and new anime that can't be reasonably cropped.

Examples can be seen in the [cover](../submission-form/images/cover.md) section.
{% endhint %}

## Recommended Dimensions for Cropping or Creation

If you have to crop or create new images, for things such as cutting out parts of larger images for better staff and character portraits, then _230x345px_ is the recommended minimum, or at least _460x690px_ to support the XL cover.

{% hint style="info" %}
Large images will be down-scaled to either _230px_ width for regular covers, or _460px_ width for XL covers. So it is fine to upload larger images.
{% endhint %}

## Recommended Banner Dimensions

Banners should ideally be _1900x400px_ for media entries.  
Uploading slightly smaller or larger images is acceptable, but up-scaling can lower the quality significantly.
