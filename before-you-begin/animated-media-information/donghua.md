# Donghua

## Database Criteria

There are limitations to donghua that can be accepted to the site, notably there should be significant creative control of the titles from Chinese and Taiwanese studios.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if a title is animated by these studios, it may not be added to the site due to significant creative decisions being made by western companies.

## Examples

Example 1:

> [Ling Qi](https://anilist.co/anime/98031/Ling-Qi/) was produced by the Chinese studio [Haoliners Animation League](https://anilist.co/studio/6140/Haoliners-Animation-League) and the primary staff \(director, writers, etc.\) are also Chinese.  
>   
> While this show does have a Japanese dub, its original language was in Chinese. Due to its production, it would be classed as Chinese donghua and not a Japanese anime.
