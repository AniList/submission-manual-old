# Aeni

## Database Criteria

There are limitations to aeni that can be accepted to the site, notably there should be significant creative control of the titles from Korean studios.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if a title is animated by these studios, it may not be added to the site due to significant creative decisions being made by western companies.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

Example 1:

> [Closers: Side Blacklambs](https://anilist.co/anime/99527/Closers-Side-Blacklambs/) was produced by the Korean studio [Studio Animal](https://anilist.co/studio/6169/Studio-Animal) and the primary staff \(director, writers, etc\) are also Korean.

Example 2:

> [The Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra) was primarily animated by the Korean studio _Mir_, however, as it was produced by an American company \(_Nickelodeon_\) and the primary staff \(director, writers, etc.\) are also American, it would not meet our guidelines for an aeni show.
