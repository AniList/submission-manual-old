# Introduction

## Preface

Adding or modifying an entry on AniList is an easy task. The main focus is making sure that data is accurate and as complete as possible for that moment in time. All sections of the form are formatted in a similar fashion and have handy tool-tips to assist you.

#### Editing Entries

Existing anime & manga entries can be edited using the edit button at the bottom left of their page.  
Existing staff & characters can be edited using the edit icon button at the top right of their page.

#### Adding New Entries

New entries can be submitted using these submission links:  
Anime: [https://anilist.co/edit/anime/new](https://anilist.co/edit/anime/new)  
Manga: [https://anilist.co/edit/manga/new](https://anilist.co/edit/manga/new)  
  
New Characters & Staff can only be created from the anime & manga's [character ](submission-form/characters/)& [staff ](submission-form/staff/)sub-pages.

#### Submission Approval

When a user provides a submission it will undergo a review process where a moderator can approve or deny the additions and/or changes made - it is extremely helpful to provide as many [sources](before-you-begin/sourcing/) as possible to confirm the information you want to submit.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware that AniList does not handle all entries the same way that other sites do.   
  
__Examples:  
[Episode 0's and Prologues](before-you-begin/animated-media-information/episode-0s-and-prologues.md) are only placed in a standalone entry if they aired in a different format from the series.  
  
[Recap ](before-you-begin/animated-media-information/recaps.md)episodes are not always included.  
  
AniList has additional [relations](submission-form/relations.md). Labelling adaptations between all formats \(anime, manga and light novel\) is also treated the same.

After making a submission, you will be able still be able to edit it, as well as view the status of your submissions, plus receive comments from any moderators working on it.
