# Introduction

## Preface

Adding or modifying an entry on AniList is an easy task. The main focus is making sure that data is accurate and as complete as possible for that moment in time. All forms are formatted in a similar fashion and have handy tool-tips to assist in each section.

When a user provides a submission it will undergo a review process where a moderator can approve or refuse the additions or changes made - it is extremely helpful to provide as many [sources](media-specification/sourcing/) as possible to confirm the change.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will be able to alter and view the status of your submissions plus receive comments from moderators working on it.
{% endhint %}

If you have any queries in relation to submitting or updating content on the site, feel free to ask a [moderator ](moderator/moderator-list.md)on the [website ](http://anilist.co)or on [Discord](http://discord.me/anilist).

Any changes to this guide or database will be announced on the [website](http://anilist.co) and also written in the manual [change log](changelog.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is _**highly recommended**_ that you read the both the [Checklist](before-you-begin/before-you-begin.md) and [Media Specification](media-specification/media-specification/) section prior to any submissions, or at least relevant sections within it.

The latter section states what _**is**_ and _**is not**_ accepted onto the database and provides many helpful tips within.
