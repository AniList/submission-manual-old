# Checklist

* Make sure the work, character, actor, or staff isn’t already in the database.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can check by running English, native language, and romaji titles through the search and [browse](https://anilist.co/search/anime) sections, as well as going through the credits of staff and characters.
{% endhint %}

* Always include as much detail as possible, as well as link to as many sources as possible in the sources panel \(even if it is in a language you can’t read\). 
* If you find a duplicate entry, contact a [moderator](../moderator/moderator-list.md). 
* The nationality of a creator does not matter if their work is first professionally published by a reputable Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Taiwanese publisher for their respective markets \(See [Country Of Origin](../submission-form-1/general/typings/untitled-8.md)\).  Example:

> [Thiago Furukawa Lucas](https://anilist.co/staff/99212/Yuu-Kamiya) \(author of [No Game, No Life](https://anilist.co/manga/78399/No-Game-No-Life/)\) is Brazilian-Japanese, but the work was initially published with Kodansha in Japanese, so his work is considered a light novel.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re unsure about anything, contact a [moderator](../moderator/moderator-list.md) and they'll be happy to offer advice or help.

However, please do not expect that you can hand a moderator a link and have them do all the work for you.
