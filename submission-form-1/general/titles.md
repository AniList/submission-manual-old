# Titles

Ensure all titles are used _**officially.**_ Do not use the native title translated into English as the English title.

### Romaji

The correct [romanisation ](../../media-specification/romanisation.md)of the title is preferred over all else and is _**required.**_

{% hint style="info" %}
Please see the [title formatting ](../../media-specification/title-formatting.md)section for information on how format titles.
{% endhint %}

### English

This field should only be filled in with the name given when the entry has been _**officially licensed**_ or is being _**officially streamed**_ in English.

English titles written on the cover or announcement of works \(often as subheadings\) are placed in the ‘[synonym](synonyms.md)’ section, as they are not licensed titles.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is acceptable to use the English title when a work is translated into English by legal streaming or reading sites such as [TOPTOON ](https://www.toptoon.net/)\(which is a Chinese service that supplies Chinese, Korean and Japanese works in English, Chinese and Japanese\). 

_**However**_, it could be replaced if a native English publisher \(such as Seven Seas, Viz etc.\) later licenses the work, or a publisher of the same native language as the original work \(Example, [TORICO ](https://www.torico-corp.com/)is a Japanese publisher that releases Japanese works in English\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
English titles created by scanlators or fansubbers are _**not**_ accepted.
{% endhint %}

### Native

The official native title.  
In almost all cases this will be written in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. However if the work primarily refers to itself in any other language, then that title should be used rather than the Japanese, Chinese, or Korean subtitle.
