# Create New Characters

## Given Name

Their given name\(s\) in correct [romanisation](../../before-you-begin/romanisation.md).

## Surname

Their surname or alias in correct [romanisation](../../before-you-begin/romanisation.md).

## Native Name

For native names, the order should be ‘_**Surname Given Name**_’ without spaces.

Example:

> [Eriko Kimura](https://anilist.co/staff/105138/Eriko-Kimura)’s native name field should be '木村絵理子' \(KimuraEriko\).
>
> A lot of current entries are incorrectly written as '絵理子木村' \(ErikoKimura\), which is the wrong way round, or '木村 絵理子' \(Kimura Eriko\), which contains a space. So, if you see it, please try to correct it.

[Dictionary browser extensions](../../before-you-begin/sourcing/tools/rikaichan-and-rikaikun.md) can help with kanji readings if you know hiragana. if not, then feel free to ask for help in [Discord](http://discord.me/anilist).
{% endhint %}

An exception to the above is when a name is natively western.

Example:

> ‘[Reinhard von Lohengramm](https://anilist.co/character/3066/Reinhard-von-Lohengramm)’ would be written as _ラインハルト・フォン・ローグラム_. Keep in mind the rules of the language the name is born from, as terms like '_von'_ and '_van_' in German would be tacked onto the start of the surname.
>
> Additionally, any middle names should be placed at the end of the given name.

## Alternative Names

Any alternative names that the character is known by, _**excluding spoilers**_. Example: [Ryo Saeba](https://anilist.co/character/2065/Ryo-Saeba) from the series [City Hunter](https://anilist.co/anime/1470/City-Hunter/) is known as _City Hunter_ by some characters.

## About

A basic description. It should be spoiler free \(or contain spoiler tags\) and contain basic information on the character. This can be hobbies, birthday, and qualities, to a background introduction.  
Example: [Akari Mizunashi](https://anilist.co/character/378)

## Image

This is the cover image for the character.

A clean headshot or head and shoulders portrait should be used where possible. There is no preference to designs if a character has appeared in various media formats.

Format should either .jpg \(.jpeg\) or .png

{% hint style="danger" %}
A character's image should _**not**_ be a spoiler for the work.  
Example: A character transforms into something else in a way that would be considered a plot spoiler.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Covers should be as close a 2:3 ratio as possible.

If you have to crop or create new images then 230x345px is the recommended minimum. Larger images will be downscaled to 230px width.

Please refer to [Image Dimensions and Templates](../../before-you-begin/image-dimensions-and-template.md), if required.
