# Banner

A suitable image to use as the header banner in the entry for the anime. As with cover images, this should be _**official**_ artwork or assets only. The image should be of decent quality and not too gaudy, it is up to yourself what you think would look good as a banner.

The image should be cropped to 1900x400 and either .jpg \(.jpeg\) or .png format. However .png banners will be converted to .jpg \(.jpeg\) for storage.
