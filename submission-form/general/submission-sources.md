## Information Sourcing Example

_Please note the sources for this example are all Japanese as there was no English information at the time. All the example is for is to help state the value of finding as much information as possible._  
  
I first heard about [Alice-tachi no Hyouhon](https://anilist.co/manga/104652) from seeing the article in Natalie's [new serialisation](https://natalie.mu/comic/tag/43) feed. The specific article is [https://natalie.mu/comic/news/304388](https://natalie.mu/comic/news/304388).  
  
This article contains the series title \(アリスたちの標本\) and the author's name \(小松万記\). It also mentions the magazine issue containing the first chapter \(週刊漫画TIMES11月2日\) went on sale on the day of article posting \(10月19日発売\). It also provides two images that could possibly be used as a temporary cover or character portraits - the first image also includes the romaji reading of the author's name. The rest of the article is a description of the story.  
  
There are two links below the article, one to the magazine \([https://shukanmanga.jp/](https://shukanmanga.jp/)\), and another to the author's Twitter \([https://twitter.com/kmtmaki](https://twitter.com/kmtmaki)\). Googling the author's name can also often bring up Twitter profiles, blogs, or wikipedia articles.  
  
The publisher's website has a sub-page for the specific magazine the manga is serialised in \([https://shukanmanga.jp/s\_times/](https://shukanmanga.jp/s_times/)\). Entering the year and month of serialisation, 2018/11 for this example, displays issues that mention the series - with the earliest stating the new serialisation, colour page, and on-sale date.  
  
At time of writing a tweet from the author was easily visible referencing the new manga \([https://twitter.com/kmtmaki/status/1051231595129012224](https://twitter.com/kmtmaki/status/1051231595129012224)\). The tweet mentions on-sale date, magazine and a description of the series. The included image also gives a bit of information about the characters and another option for character portraits. The author's twitter avatar can also be used for their profile image on AniList, as well as including his Twitter link in their bio.  
  
_Altogether, the links above of the news article, magazine, and authors' twitter, contain enough information, reinforced between them, to create a decent looking submission._
