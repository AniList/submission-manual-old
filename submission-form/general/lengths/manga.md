# Manga

Volume and chapter counts are only added when the work is completed or confirmed complete. if the work is still publishing, both remain at _**zero**_.

One-Shots should have the chapter count as _**one**_ and the volume count left as _**zero**_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The use of ‘original’ below is due to the fact that series can have new editions printed, omnibus volumes if licensed, etc. These can have different counts than the original runs.
{% endhint %}

## Chapters

The total number of chapters in the _**original**_ serialization of the work. This does include things such as ‘side’ chapters \(Example: Chapter 5.5\), bonus chapters and some prologues and epilogues.

This does not exclude special pages for things such as advertising volume releases or author comments.

## Volumes

The total number of volumes in the _**original**_ print or eBook run of the work.
