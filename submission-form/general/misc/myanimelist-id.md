# MyAnimeList ID

The ID number for the entry as per [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/). This can be found at the end of the URL.

For example, the first _City Hunter_ anime has the URL [http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1470), with the ID being _**1470**_. Please make sure you are linking the _**correct**_ anime or manga ID as this is used to accurately import lists.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Warning: Please _**don’t**_ add a [MyAnimeList ](https://myanimelist.net/)ID if the entry is _**unapproved**_. You can normally spot unapproved entries as they will be on zero user lists and zero user favourites.

Each submission to [MyAnimeList ](https://myanimelist.net/)generates its own ID, so it’s possible that the ID for the entry submitted to [AniList ](https://anilist.co)will _**not**_ be the ID of the entry that [MyAnimeList ](https://myanimelist.net/)later approves.

Incorrect IDs mean users using the import feature will receive an error or incorrect entry. Unfortunately, [MyAnimeList ](https://myanimelist.net/)can often take a long time to approve works \(more so for manga\), as such you may not be able to link entries for a while.
