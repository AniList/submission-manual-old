# Forum Thread

This will create automated threads in the Release Discussion section of the forum 24 hours after a new episode of an airing anime being released. This can be used at your own discretion as to whether you feel that relevant discussion will be generated on the thread. Excessive use could cause a high amount of empty threads.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users may also wish to create their own threads and it can be disabled for this purpose. If the option is enabled, a post will not be made if one has already been created by a user.
