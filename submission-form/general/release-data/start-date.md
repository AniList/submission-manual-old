# Start and End Date

### Start Date

The date that the work began airing or began serialisation.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a title releases early but then continues that release in a regular schedule, the start date should reflect that earlier release and the airing episode count should reflect it as well.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a title was pre-screened at an event, regardless of location, the _**normal**_ broadcast date is to be used. 
{% endhint %}

### End Date

The date that the work is confirmed to have finished airing or finished serialisation.
