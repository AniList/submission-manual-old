# Description

A basic, spoiler-free description of the entry. This should be in English and a source provided \(whether taken from another site or written by yourself\).

![The description for the &apos;Ao Buta&apos; anime](../../.gitbook/assets/description.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Descriptions use HTML.   
Please use &lt;br&gt; for line breaks.  
Links can be added as so: &lt;a href="website"&gt;NAME&lt;/a&gt;
{% endhint %}

### Formatting Best Practices

**1\) HTML Code**  
  
&lt;br&gt; is for line break. _**Always**_ use this whenever there is a line break.

Example:

> Mari's girlfriend, Arisa, loses her memories of the past three years, including all memory of their life together. However, it turns out that being crazy in love with someone transcends all realms of possibility.&lt;br&gt;  
> &lt;br&gt;  
> \(Source: Girls in Boxes\)

Will produce:

> Mari's girlfriend, Arisa, loses her memories of the past three years, including all memory of their life together. However, it turns out that being crazy in love with someone transcends all realms of possibility.  
>   
> \(Source: Girls in Boxes\)

{% hint style="info" %}
&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are for **bold** and _italic_**,** __but don't forget to use &lt;/b&gt; or &lt;/i&gt; at the end of the text you want to format.
{% endhint %}

**2\) Always cite source wherever you got that synopsis.**

Example: \(Source: MU\) or \(Source: MangaHelpers\).  
  
**3\) If the entry includes one-shots, use:**

> &lt;b&gt;Included one-shot:&lt;/b&gt; Romaji Title \(Translated Title \(if available\)\).

It should be placed at the bottom of the description.   
  
Example:[ ](https://anilist.co/manga/87146) [Mayoke no Darling](https://anilist.co/manga/87146)  
Example if the manga has multiple volumes:[ ](https://anilist.co/manga/69291) [Nijiiro Days](https://anilist.co/manga/69291)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't forget to put the one-shot names in the synonyms.
{% endhint %}

**4\) For compilations or anthologies, enter:**

> Chapter Number. &lt;b&gt;Romaji Title&lt;/b&gt; \(Kanji, Translation\); Magazine \(dated\)

Example: 

> 6-9. Imouto☆Control \(いもうと☆こんとろーる\); Comic Megastore 2011-10, 2012-02, 07, kakioroshi

This means it's chapter 6-9 on that compilation manga.

Example Compilation:[ ](https://anilist.co/manga/92817) [Hatsukoi Ribbon](https://anilist.co/manga/92817)  
Example Anthology:[ ](https://anilist.co/manga/45515) [Gunjou Gakusha](https://anilist.co/manga/45515)

**5\) Use italics if the description mentions the work.**

> _Bakuman_ follows the story of high school student Moritaka Mashiro**...**

Example:[ ](https://anilist.co/manga/39711) [Bakuman.](https://anilist.co/manga/39711)
