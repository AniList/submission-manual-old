# Adding Staff

The staff page will let you manage the people that were involved in creating the work. Adding existing staff, creating new staff, and assigning their roles are all done here.

### Add Staff

The popup after pressing the ‘_Add Staff_’ button will let you search for the staff member you want to link, which you can then select and confirm. Back on the main page, you’ll now be able to add a role.
